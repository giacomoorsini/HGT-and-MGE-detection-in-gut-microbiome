# HGT detection tools
This repository contains information about tools for horizontal gene transmission detection. In particular, for each tool, there is:
- a small tutorial
- installation instructions/ conda environments for installation
- scripts used

The tools WAAFLE (https://github.com/biobakery/waafle) and MetaCHIP (https://github.com/songweizhi/MetaCHIP) have been selected as the most promising and have been used.
